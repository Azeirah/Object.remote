    This page creates live-cards out of objects, comparable in functionality to DAT.gui, only this is automatically synced, automatically adds and removes guis whenever objects come and go, has additional support for component cards, which are cards specialized for my class library AND is remote, meaning it can run wherever you want, even on phones...

    To use this remote, first fire up the server, then open this page, ensuring a connection with the server, and last open a remote object page.
    You can try <a href="../../clients/simple.html">the demo example</a> or <a href="http://martijnbrekelmans.com/game">my demo game</a>, which uses the component cards.
