    <p>This is the remote client. To get this working right, have the server running first, then open this page. After that, open the client page.</p>
    <p>What <em>should</em> happen, is the client should immediately display
    <pre>{
    "a": 15
}</pre>

    and this page shouldn't display any object, until the client page is opened.
    When the client page has been opened, this page should show the same object as above.

    After 1.5 seconds, this page will update the object's a value to 200, both pages should then show

    <pre>{
    "a": 200
}</pre>
    </p>
