    This is the generic remote client, which will create similar kind of editable object "cards", which can be used to edit any generic remoteObject without having to use the component framework (which, as far as I'm concerned, won't even be released at all).

    Another page is the remote client to work with components using the component framework, as an example, you can open this page, then play my game at martijnbrekelmans.com/game, start the remoteObjectServer and edit the game in run-time.

    As last, there's the super generic visualizer example, which simply visualizes the received data as a formatted JSON string.
